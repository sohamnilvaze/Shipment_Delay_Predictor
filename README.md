# Shipment Delay Prediction and Optimization

This project is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict whether a shipment will be delayed based on key parameters such as origin, destination, vehicle type, and weather conditions. It allows users to input shipment details and receive a prediction about potential delays. Additionally, the application provides an optimization feature, enabling users to experiment with parameter values to determine conditions under which the shipment is likely to be on time.

## Features

- Shipment Delay Prediction
- Interactive Web Interface
- Parameter Optimization for On-Time Shipments



## Deployment

To run the Flask app locally on your machine

1)Clone the repository
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sohamnilvaze/Shipment_Delay_Predictor.git
```
2)Install the required dependencies:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3)Start the Flask app:
```bash
  python3 app.py
```
4)Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
